Within this project
we know how to use a java project with maven

After having analyzed the subject I understood it in the way:

1-we consider that the employee has to work every 22 days of the month so there is not a day where he is absent ..
2-the figures you have given us is the 1200PLN conversions, 800 EURO, 600 GPB I considered it the minimum wage that an employee can have depending on the country.
3-and a class that implements JUNIT for the tests of the different methods implemented.
As part of this project we were able to have an understanding of how wages work in different countries in Europe.
This is a great opportunity for me to see the continent where I come from.
Thank you for giving me an opportunity to participate in this project ...
I am at the disposal of any suggestions
